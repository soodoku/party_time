                       THE FIVE NATION STUDY CONDUCTED BY GABRIEL A. ALMOND     
                  AND SIDNEY VERBA IS COMPRISED OF ABOUT ONE THOUSAND INTER-    
                  VIEWS CONDUCTED IN EACH OF FIVE NATIONS: UNITED STATES, ITALY,
                  UNITED KINGDOM, GERMANY, AND MEXICO.  THE INTERVIEWS TOOK     
                  PLACE DURING JUNE AND JULY, 1959 IN ALL COUNTRIES EXCEPT THE  
                  U.S. WHERE THEY TOOK PLACE IN MARCH, 1960.  THE STUDY WAS AN  
                  ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ATTITUDES   
                  HELD BY THE CITIZENS OF A COUNTRY AND THE FUNCTIONING OF A    
                  MODERN DEMOCRATIC STATE.  IN ADDITION, IT INCLUDED QUESTIONS  
                  ABOUT THE RESPONDENTS' BACKGROUNDS AND INTERESTS.             
                       THE STUDY CONCENTRATED ON TAPPING RESPONDENTS' BASIC     
                  POLITICAL ATTITUDES BY MEANS OF QUESTIONS EMPHASIZING POLI-   
                  TICAL PARTISANSHIP, POLITICAL SOCIALIZATION, AND ATTITUDES    
                  TOWARD SPECIFIC INSTITUTIONS, AS WELL AS THE POLITICAL        
                  SYSTEM AND CULTURE AS A WHOLE.  SPECIFIC VARIABLES INCLUDED   
                  IN THE STUDY WERE RESPONDENTS' POLITICAL AWARENESS AND FEEL-  
                  INGS OF POLITICAL EFFICACY, FEELINGS TOWARD BUREAUCRACY,      
                  POLICE, POLITICAL PARTIES, CAMPAIGNING, DIFFERENT LEVELS OF   
                  GOVERNMENT, AND SUCH INSTITUTIONS AS THE SCHOOL, THE FAMILY,  
                  AND THE PLACE OF WORK.  THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF ORGANIZA-     
                  TIONS TO WHICH RESPONDENTS BELONGED WERE RECORDED, AS WELL AS 
                  INFORMATION BEARING ON THE RESPONDENTS' OWN UPBRINGINGS AND   
                  EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES.                                      
                       THE INTERVIEW FORMAT WAS LARGELY STRUCTURED, WITH IN-    
                  TERVIEWS RANGING IN LENGTH FROM ABOUT FORTY MINUTES TO SOME-  
                  WHAT OVER AN HOUR.  ABOUT 10% OF THE QUESTIONS WERE OPEN-     
                  ENDED.  THE PRIMARY PUBLICATION RESULTING FROM THIS STUDY

                  RESEARCH CENTER, CHICAGO, USING A STRATIFIED MULTI-STAGE      
                  PROBABILITY SAMPLE.  IN THE FIRST STAGE STANDARD              
                  METROPOLITAN AREAS AND INDIVIDUAL NON-METROPOLITAN COUNTIES   
                  WERE STRATIFIED ACCORDING TO VARIOUS DEMOGRAPHIC              
                  CHARACTERISTICS.  FROM EACH OF 66 STRATA PRIMARY SAMPLING     
                  UNITS WERE SELECTED.  WITHIN EACH PRIMARY SAMPLING UNIT A     
                  SAMPLE OF LOCALITIES WAS SYSTEMATICALLY SELECTED.  WITHIN     
                  EACH OF THE THIRD-STAGE UNITS ONE OR TWO SEGMENTS, TOTALING   
                  461, WERE SELECTED WITH A PROBABILITY PROPORTIONATE TO THE

                  SPECIFIED GEOGRAPHIC ORDER.  FOR EACH DWELLING UNIT SELECTED  
                  BY A SAMPLING RATIO, THE INTERVIEWER WAS ASSIGNED A SPECIFIC  
                  SELECTION TABLE TO BE EMPLOYED IN DETERMINING WHICH MEMBER    
                  OF EACH FAMILY WAS TO BE INTERVIEWED.  THE NUMBER OF

                  LONDON, USING A MULTISTAGE PROBABILITY SAMPLE WITH THE        
                  ELECTORAL REGISTER AS A SAMPLING FRAME.  IN STAGE ONE, 40     
                  CONSTITUENCIES WERE CHOSEN.  IN STAGE TWO, TWO WARDS WERE     
                  SELECTED FOR EACH CHOSEN CONSTITUENCY.  IN STAGE THREE, ONE   
                  POLLING DISTRICT WAS RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM EACH WARD.  IN    
                  STAGE FOUR, INDIVIDUALS WERE SELECTED FROM EACH POLLING       
                  DISTRICT BY TAKING NAMES AT FIXED INTERVALS.  A SPECIAL       
                  PROVISION WAS MADE TO OBTAIN A SAMPLE OF NON-ELECTORS.        
                  THE NUMBER OF COMPLETED INTERVIEWS WAS EQUAL TO 963, 59% OF

                  TO SELECT RESPONDENTS TWO STRATA WERE FORMED, THE FIRST       
                  INCLUDING ALL COMMUNITIES WITH LESS THAN 2,000 INHABITANTS    
                  AND THE SECOND INCLUDING ALL WITH 2,000 INHABITANTS OR        
                  MORE.  SMALL UNITS OR CELLS WERE FORMED SEPARATELY FOR        
                  EACH STRATUM ACCORDING TO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL POP-    
                  ULATION LIVING IN THESE STRATA, WITH 38 IN THE FIRST STRA-    
                  TUM AND 62 IN THE SECOND.  ONE SAMPLE POINT WAS SELECTED      
                  FROM EACH CELL USING RANDOM NUMBERS.  HOUSEHOLDS WERE DRAWN   
                  FROM A CENTRAL REGISTER OF INHABITANTS OF THE RESPECTIVE      
                  COMMUNITIES IN SYSTEMATIC SELECTION, USING A RANDOM NUMBER    
                  AS A STARTING POINT.  RESPONDENTS WERE SELECTED BY RANDOM     
                  NUMBERS FROM A LIST OF HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS AGED 18 OR OVER.     
                  THE NUMBER OF COMPLETED INTERVIEWS WAS 955, OR 74% OF THE

                  DELL'OPINIONE PUBBLICA, MILAN, USING A MULTI-STAGE STRATIFIED 
                  RANDOM SAMPLE.  IN STAGE ONE, ITALY WAS DIVIDED INTO 92       
                  PROVINCES.  ON THE BASIS OF EIGHT VARIABLES 13 STRATA WERE    
                  OBTAINED.  FROM EACH ONE PROVINCE WAS RANDOMLY SELECTED.      
                  IN STAGE TWO, TWO COMMUNES WITHIN EACH OF THE 13 PROVINCES    
                  WERE STRATIFIED ACCORDING TO POPULATION, RESULTING IN 49      
                  STRATA.  FROM EACH OF THESE A COMMUNE WAS RANDOMLY SELECTED.  
                  IN STAGE THREE, PERSONS OVER 21 WERE SELECTED FROM EACH       
                  COMMUNE BY THE USE OF GENERAL ELECTORAL REGISTERS.  PERSONS   
                  BETWEEN 18-21 WERE SELECTED FROM HOUSEHOLDS OF ELECTORS       
                  SELECTED AT RANDOM.  THE NUMBER OF COMPLETED INTERVIEWS WAS   
                  EQUAL TO 995, 74% OF TOTAL SAMPLE.

                  STAGE STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLE.  URBAN CENTERS OF OVER        
                  10,000 WERE DIVIDED INTO FIVE STRATA.  LOCALITIES RANDOMLY    
                  SELECTED WITHIN THE STRATA WERE CHOSEN WITH A PROBABILITY

                  INTERVIEWS WHICH SHOULD DERIVE FROM EACH STRATUM WAS MADE     
                  IN ACCORDANCE WITH CENSUS DATA.  MEXICO CITY INTERVIEWS WERE  
                  UPWEIGHTED BY 2.5 IN ORDER TO REPRESENT THEIR TRUE            
                  PROPORTION WITHIN THE SAMPLE.  THE NUMBER OF COMPLETED

                      THE FIVE NATION STUDY WAS PROCESSED ACCORDING TO STAN-    
                  DARD ICPR PROCESSING PROCEDURES.  WHERE APPLICABLE, STANDARD  
                  CODES WERE USED.  THE DATA WERE CHECKED FOR INCONSISTENT AND  
                  ILLEGAL CODES, AND, WHENEVER FOUND, THESE CODES WERE CHANGED  
                  TO "NOT ASCERTAINED" OR "INAP.".                              
                       CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS CODEBOOK DESERVE ATTENTION.     
                  EACH VARIABLE IS HEADED BY A "VARIABLE NAME" WHICH, IN MOST   
                  CASES, CONTAINS SEVERAL ABBREVIATED WORDS.  IF NECESSARY,     
                  THE ABBREVIATIONS CAN BE TRANSLATED BY REFERRING TO THE       
                  UNABBREVIATED VARIABLE NAME WHICH APPEARS IN THE TABLE OF     
                  CONTENTS BELOW.  EACH VARIABLE IS ALSO GIVEN A "VARIABLE      
                  NUMBER" AND A "REFERENCE NUMBER" WHICH IN THIS CODEBOOK ARE   
                  IDENTICAL.                                                    
                       CERTAIN CODES ARE LABELLED MISSING DATA CODES ("MD").    
                  THIS INFORMATION IS USED BY SOME ISR ANALYSIS PROGRAMS.  IT   
                  IS THE ONLY MEANING OR USE OF THIS SPECIFICATION; IT DOES     
                  NOT MEAN THAT THE USER SHOULD NOT OR CANNOT USE THESE CODES   
                  IN A SUBSTANTIVE ROLE IF HE SO DESIRES.  "GE," USED IN THE    
                  SPECIFICATION OF MISSING DATA CODES MEANS "GREATER THAN OR    
                  EQUAL TO."  PLEASE NOTE THAT, IN ANY CASE, FOR MANY USERS     
                  THE ONLY CRUCIAL INFORMATION IN THE VARIABLE HEADER IS THE    
                  DECK AND COLUMN NUMBERS, WHICH ARE FOUND ON THE THIRD LINE    
                  ON THE RIGHT.                                                 
                       THE FIVE NATION STUDY WAS COMBINED FROM FIVE SEPARATE    
                  FILES, ONE FOR EACH OF THE FIVE COUNTRIES, INTO ONE FILE.     
                  THE DATA FOR A SINGLE COUNTRY OR A SUBSET OF COUNTRIES CAN    
                  BE OBTAINED BY FILTERING BY THE COUNTRY VARIABLE, REF. NO.    
                  TWO.  (NOTE: DATA FOR A SINGLE COUNTRY WILL BE AVAILABLE      
                  UPON REQUEST.)  THE VARIABLE NUMBERS AND THE LOCATIONS OF     
                  THE DATA ARE THE SAME FOR ALL COUNTRIES.  IN INSTANCES WHERE  
                  A QUESTION WAS NOT ASKED IN ALL COUNTRIES, THESE VARIABLES    
                  HAVE BEEN GIVEN "INAP." CODES.  IN SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE    
                  VARIABLES HAD DIFFERING "INAP." SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE FIVE   
                  COUNTRIES, THESE WERE INDICATED FOR EACH COUNTRY.  ALL THE    
                  COUNTRIES ARE UNWEIGHTED EXCEPT MEXICO WHICH HAS WEIGHTS OF   
                  1, 2, AND 3.  THE WEIGHT VARIABLE OCCURS IN COLUMN 80 OF      
                  EACH DECK.  (NOTE FOR OSIRIS/40 USERS: THE WEIGHT VARIABLE,   
                  REF. NO. FOUR, OCCURS IN A TAPE LOCATION BETWEEN THOSE OF     
                  REF. NOS. THREE AND FIVE.)                                    
                       THE FREQUENCIES FOR ALL OF THE VARIABLES FOR ALL FIVE    
                  COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CODEBOOK.  IN MOST IN-    
                  STANCES THE FREQUENCIES FOR GERMANY ARE TO THE LEFT OF THE    
                  CODES AND THE FREQUENCIES FOR THE OTHER FOUR COUNTRIES ARE    
                  BELOW THE CODES FOR THE VARIABLES TO WHICH THEY REFER.  IN    
                  CASES WHERE A VARIABLE HAS SEPARATE CODES FOR EACH COUNTRY,   
                  AS IS THE CASE WITH THE REGION VARIABLE, THE FREQUENCIES FOR

                  FOR MULTIPLE RESPONSE VARIABLES, THE FREQUENCIES REPRESENT    
                  THE ACCUMULATED FREQUENCIES ACROSS THE RESPONSES.             
                       ITEMS APPEARING BETWEEN GREATER THAN AND LESSER THAN

                  CONDUCTED BY THE PRIME MINISTER, HIS CABINET AND PARLIAMENT   
                  (U.K., GERMANY, AND ITALY).  SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THERE       
                  IS REALLY NO NEED FOR THE MONARCHY (U.K.) OR THE              
                  PRESIDENCY (GERMANY AND ITALY).  WHAT DO YOU THINK.           
                  IS THE MONARCHY (PRESIDENCY) NEEDED OR NOT.

                  SAY THAT HE SHOULD BE AN ACTIVE LEADER OF HIS OWN PARTY.      
                  WHAT VIEW DO YOU THINK IS CORRECT.
